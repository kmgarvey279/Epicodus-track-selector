      <h4>Would you rather work on the front-end or the back-end side of development? Front-end primarily focuses more on the user experence and might be a good fit for you if you enjoy creating asthetically appealing layouts, design, and visuals. Back-end focuses on the "behind-the-scenes" aspects of web pages and applications that store, organize, and maniplulate data. It may be a good fit for you if you enjoy figuring out how complex systems work and coming up with solutions to difficult problems. </h4>
